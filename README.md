# Pyra-Box: Project Assignment

This project is a responsive web application built with React and TypeScript, created as part of an assignment. The application allows users to create and manage a pyramid of boxes, with features for dynamically adding and removing boxes, adjusting their size, and controlling the gap between them. The design ensures a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Overview

The objective of this assignment was to develop an interactive and responsive web app that meets the following requirements:

- Users can dynamically add and remove rows of boxes to form a pyramid structure.
- Users can adjust the size of the boxes and the gaps between them using sliders.
- The application must be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on various devices, including desktops and mobile phones.

## Features

- **Dynamic Pyramid Structure**: Add and remove rows and boxes to customize the pyramid.
- **Box Size Control**: Adjust the box size with a slider.
- **Gap Control**: Adjust the gap between boxes with a slider.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, scaling appropriately for mobile devices.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
